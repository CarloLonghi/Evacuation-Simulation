# Evacuation-Simulation
Agent-based model of the interaction between individuals in an emergency scenario, created in Netlogo.


The interactions between people in a crowd can be modeled as an agent-based game. 
Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) approaches can be applied to different kinds of games to simulate the evolution of a system.
I propose a trivial agent-based model to study crowd evacuations during some kind of emergency. I focus on the interactions between people in an emergency scenario.
The results obtained suggest that this simple model can be useful to study the effectiveness of different safety measures.
